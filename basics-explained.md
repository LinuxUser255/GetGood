The selected code snippet demonstrates the process of converting a string to an integer in Python. 

In this example, a string variable `number_as_string` is assigned the value '20'. The `print` function is then used to display the value of `number_as_string`. 

The next line, `converted_number = int(number_as_string)`, demonstrates the conversion of the string to an integer using the `int()` function. The converted integer value is then stored in the variable `converted_number`.

Finally, the `print` function is used to display the value of `converted_number`, which shows that the string has been successfully converted to an integer.

This code snippet is part of a larger program that demonstrates various data types and their conversions in Python.

_Decorators_

If there is an operation that you want to perform on a function, multiple times,
then that is a use case for a decorator.

It modifies the function call and potentially what is being returned

The selected code defines a decorator function named `decorator_example`. Decorators in Python are a way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without directly changing their source code. Let's break down this decorator:

1. The `decorator_example` function takes a function `func` as an argument. This will be the function that we want to decorate.

2. Inside `decorator_example`, there's an inner function called `wrapper`. This function will wrap around the original function, adding extra functionality before and after its execution.

3. The `wrapper` function uses `*args` and `**kwargs`. This allows it to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments, making the decorator flexible and able to work with any function regardless of its parameters.

4. Inside `wrapper`:
   - It prints a message before calling the original function, including the name of the function being called.
   - It then calls the original function `func` with all the arguments passed to `wrapper`.
   - After the function call, it prints another message.
   - Finally, it returns the result of the original function.

5. The `decorator_example` function returns the `wrapper` function. This is what allows the decorator to modify the behavior of the decorated function.

When you use this decorator with the `@` syntax (as shown in the `say_hello` function definition later in the code), it effectively wraps the decorated function with this additional behavior.

This decorator will print messages before and after the execution of any function it decorates, which can be useful for logging, timing functions, or adding any kind of pre- or post-processing to function calls.

You're absolutely correct. This is indeed a nested function, which is a key feature of how decorators work in Python. Let's break it down:

**File: /home/linux/Projects/PycharmProjects/GetGood/basics.py**
```python
def decorator_example(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f'Decorator func: Before calling {func.__name__}')
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f'Decorator func: After calling {func.__name__}')
        return result
    return wrapper
```

1. `decorator_example` is the outer function. It takes a function `func` as an argument.

2. Inside `decorator_example`, there's an inner function called `wrapper`. This is the nested function.

3. The `wrapper` function is defined inside `decorator_example`, but it's not immediately executed. Instead, `decorator_example` returns this `wrapper` function.

4. When the decorator is applied to another function (like `say_hello`), Python effectively does this:
   ```python
   say_hello = decorator_example(say_hello)
   ```
   This means `say_hello` is replaced with the `wrapper` function returned by `decorator_example`.

5. The `wrapper` function can access both its own parameters (`*args` and `**kwargs`) and the `func` parameter of the outer `decorator_example` function. This is a closure, a powerful feature of nested functions in Python.

This nested function structure allows the decorator to add functionality before and after the decorated function's execution, while still maintaining the ability to pass arguments to the original function and return its result.
